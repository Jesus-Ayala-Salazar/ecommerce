Site opens up on the home page. All other pages are reachable from the collapsible hamburger menu button on the top-right corner. The Team page includes a brief introduction to all 3 of our team members. The Products page includes a responsive grid containing all 12 of our products. Each individual product page is reached by clicking on a product from the Products page. The product information and its order form are found on its specific page.

The requirements for the project are filled as followed:
1. Our business overview, products and team info are included in the three main pages of our site: Home, Products, and Team.
2. Our Products page lists 12 products total, with each product existing in its own specific cell.
3. Our products all have their own unique images, seen on the Products page.
4. Product color, name, and price are all listed with each product within their cell, seen on the Products page.
5. Clicking on a product from the Products page leads to its own specific product page, with a product description, product ID, and the restated price.
6. An order form exists on all individual product pages. Users are required to fill in their name, shipping address, shipping method, and all relevant billing or contact information to place an order.
7. Upon submission, the site opens up the user's native email client, populating the subject and body of the email with the order details that the user had just typed into the form. From there, the user must manually hit send on the email.
8. The form will not allow a user to submit it (and will not open up the email client) unless all fields are filled and follow relevant guidelines for their information. For example, zipcodes that are too long  or credit card numbers over 16 digits or with letters in them will prompt an error message. Other relevant checks are also in place.
9. Our site uses one main CSS page, which allows us to style our site in a clean and cohesive style. 
10. When changing the size of the screen (especially in the case of mobile vs. desktop), the size of assets, as well as the formatting of our products table or product pages, will adequately change. No matter the screen size, we attempt to reduce clutter while keeping assets large enough to be viewable.
11. On an individual product page, hovering over a product's image will increase its size.

* the names of all group members is included in the head of each individual page, as well as on the Team page.
