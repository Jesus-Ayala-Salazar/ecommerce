Site opens up on the home page, from home.html. All other pages are reachable from the collapsible hamburger menu button on the top-right corner. A user can log in directly from the secondary banner on the homepage, and logging in leads to a page that displays a user's most recently purchased items. The Team page includes a brief introduction to all 3 of our team members. The Products page includes a responsive grid containing all 12 of our products, rendered by pulling data directly from a database of our products. Each individual product page is reached by clicking on a product from the Products page, also rendered dynamically through use of servlets. Products are added to a cart from an individual product page, and the order can be completed on the cart page. 

The requirements for the project are filled as followed:
1. We have a servlet (ProductsServlet.java) that is dedicated to displaying all our products by pulling information from a database. Another one of our servlets (welcome.java) handles displaying the last 5 products a user bought, as well as displaying a general welcome page after a user logs in. From this welcome page, a user can rate any of the products that show up in their recent purchases. 
2. Each product details page is rendered by ProductDetailsServlet.java, using information forwarded from the product page on-click to determine what product is rendered. The add to cart button exists on every individual page, and it saves the product to a cart that is specific to an individual session.  The form will not allow a user to submit an order if any fields are incorrectly filled in.
3. Submitting an entire order (consisting of everything in cart) saves the order to our external database, in turn updating a user's recent purchases (this can be checked by accessing the welcome page again). Submitting also forwards a user to a confirmation page that displays their order detais.
4. The checkout page (rendered by CartServlet.java) shows all items in a user's session-specific cart and the cart total. The order form is filled in on this page, and submitting it forwards all the information entered in the form to another servlet (ThankYou.java) to render an order details page.

* the names of all group members is included in the head of each individual page, as well as on the Team page.
